## Description: 
This was a class project for Computing and Programming Fundamentals in Applied Mathematics & Statistics (AMS 325) at Stony Brook University. For this project, Regression Analysis (Linear Regression) was applied to analyze various factors that would affect housing prices. For this project, we chose to focus on furnished houses. We used python libraries such as pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, statsmodels, scipy, numpy, and sklearn for data cleaning, visualization, and analysis. Then, we presented our findings through clear, data-driven reports, and visualizations (via Google Slides/PowerPoint).
