## Description: 
This was a class project for Computing and Programming Fundamentals in Applied Mathematics & Statistics (AMS 325) 
AMS 325 at Stony Brook University. For this project, applied Regression Analysis (Linear Regression) was used to analyze housing prices. For this project, we chose to focus on furnished houses.

    - The report begins with an introduction to our project & literature review.
    - For Methods, we discuss data pre-processing techniques, testing the four assumptions of Linear Regression (Linearity,        Homoscedasticity, Normality, and Independence), various transformations, model selection, & model comparison.         Hypothesis tesing was done as well. 
    - The conclusion contained interpretations based on findings in our Methods section and suggestions for future studies.
